Simple angular directive for hiding a element on a DOM click outside of itself.

## Usage ##
Include the file in your document and change the module name to your desired module name.
Add the directive to any element that you want to hide when a click is made outside of the element.
Give the directive the optional "watchMe" flag and it will watch for a falsy change and hide the element.
